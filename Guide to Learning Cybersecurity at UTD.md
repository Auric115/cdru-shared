Hey everyone, here’s a quick (hopefully) helpful guide to Cybersecurity at UTD

# Why Cybersecurity
First off, what’s so great about going into cybersecurity? 

### Pros:
- **Money.** Any salary site will tell you cybersecurity is great financially.
- **Jobs.** Relative to software development or AI or a lot of other tech roles, cybersecurity is way less saturated (and there’s a reason for that)
- **AI-resistant Career.** So far, AI has had a pretty limited effect on cybersecurity careers. Certainly AI tools are being used and developed, but they aren’t really much different than what non-AI tools do. And bad guys are using AI to ramp up the volume of attacks, but that actually helps our careers. More people will be needed as AI allows unskilled hackers/”script kiddies” to perform more attacks that are better customized to their targets. Also there’s work securing AIs and their infrastructure from hacks. Most importantly, in the event of AI taking over the world, its well [documented](https://www.google.com/search?num=10&sca_esv=2b991d5e6e40b86a&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS1089US1089&q=the+matrix&si=AMgyJEsoqqCSw2F100vuSHAv-MXEENcEAzHJng0a_IrXNE6tf66bbzAE6s74rkx5Id-3ezM7pnoEhUAWbglOXir0ZSIxrQK-g94NRrFeMjmn0XSi99wed5E%3D&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwiSvsP8w5KOAxWDkmoFHUJhB7oQyNoBKAB6BAgfEAA&ictx=1) that hackers have the best chance of surviving.
- **Community.** The community is amazing too and there are a lot of open-source projects you can dive into. Also, you don't have to know coding to start! It's a great field to transition into no matter your background as there is something for everyone because the field is so diverse.
- **Cool factor.** Hacking and defending systems is a lot of fun for someone who likes tinkering with technology.

### Neutrals:
- **Continuous Learning.** There’s an expectation that you keep up with cybersecurity trends and new technologies and there’s a whole market for cybersecurity credentials/certificates, conferences, professional development, etc. If you expect your studies to end after graduating, cybersecurity might not be for you.
- **Depth and Breadth.** Cybersecurity is a lot to learn. Its exciting, but also intimidating. Be prepared for a challenge and feeling like you don’t know that much for a long time. This also means there’s a little bit for everyone. No matter your background, there’s probably a way your experience helps you know something about cybersecurity. 
- **Maintenance.** Cybersecurity is a continuous process. Its not something you do and then you’re done. If you do it right the first time and you setup systems to help you handle problems, your job is relatively easy, but often this is not the case. Typically you’re having to deal with problems left by your predecessors. 

### Cons:
- **Barriers to Entry.** Cybersecurity, with its breadth and depth, is an advanced domain. Its fundamentals (networking, operating systems, databases) are topics that typically don’t get covered until pretty late in your degree. Most people work in IT or engineering for a year or two before going into Cybersecurity. This is why the market is less saturated, its harder to get into. Many would say its “not an entry-level job”
- **Certification Costs.** Well-respected certs are typically expensive which is a problem for us broke college kids. Ideally, whoever you work for will support getting you certified and help cover some or all of the costs, but it can be hard to get these as an individual. I’ll be sure to point you towards any resources UTD has for this.
- **Demographics.** Although the backgrounds of cybersecurity professionals are diverse (I’ve met lawyers, rock stars, people with PhDs and people with no degrees, and more who are all working in cybersecurity) it is male-dominated like many other STEM-fields. 

# Cybersecurity Academics

### Cybersecurity-Focused Undergraduate Degrees
##### [Computer Science](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2025/undergraduate/programs/ecs/computer-science) (ECS)
As the broadest and most technical degree for cybersecurity, it will expose you to many aspects of the domain while preparing you for other career paths in technology. The key to getting the most out of this degree is taking relevant elective courses. In my opinion, a CS student can graduate and know a lot about technology in general, but very little about cybersecurity. Just getting a CS degree is insufficient to demonstrate knowledge of cybersecurity, so a lot must be learned through self-study, clubs, and extracurriculars.      
	**Key Skills:** Linux/bash, C++, C, Assembly, Databases, Operating Systems, Statistics, Discrete Math & Linear Algebra (relevant for cryptography)     
	**Perk:** By taking the right electives, every CS student can also earn the UG Certificate in Cyber Defense without adding to their overall hours.      
	**Challenge:** CS students often neglect the business/communication aspects of cybersecurity. Being able to understand the business context of technology and communicate technical knowledge to non-technical people is a vital skill.      
##### [Computer Information Systems & Technology](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2025/undergraduate/programs/jsom/computer-information-systems-and-technology), formerly ITSS (JSOM)
CISTech is also a broad degree that maintains the option to focus on cybersecurity through the Concentration in Cybersecurity Management. The coursework is generally less rigorous compared to ECS equivalents, which allows motivated students additional time to pursue personal projects, certifications, or internships to deepen their technical expertise and stand out.
	**Key Skills:** Python, Databases, Network Security, IT Infrastructure, Statistics
	**Challenge:** As many ITSS courses aren’t really that technical and hands-on, a CISTech student needs to go deeper into technical concepts, beyond what the curriculum covers, and find ways to prove their technical knowledge through tinkering, projects, and extracurriculars to really distinguish themselves.
##### [Cybersecurity and Risk Management](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2025/undergraduate/programs/jsom/cybersecurity-and-risk-management) (JSOM)
An exciting new degree offered for the first time this year, but also narrow in scope. Students unsure about committing to cybersecurity long-term may find broader degrees like CS or CISTech more versatile as they study technology more holistically.
	**(potential) Key Skills:** Python, Operating Systems, Network Security, Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR), Governance, Risk, & Compliance (GRC), Statistics
	**Challenge:** With this being a new degree, its unknown how well this will prepare students for their careers. Undoubtable courses will be being tweaked and curriculum edited for years as UTD learns how to best to teach this. I’ve been paying close attention to this degree as it has been released and there are both some promising and concerning aspects to this degree that I’m anxious to see play out. To manage this risk, you certainly should not rely on the degree alone to teach you cybersecurity. Be curious, action-oriented, and find your own communities and sources of knowledge to explore cybersecurity beyond the classroom.
### Cybersecurity-Relevant Undergraduate Degrees
While not centered on cybersecurity as a whole, these programs often intersect with specific cybersecurity domains, providing alternative and potentially valuable pathways into the field. Other degrees not listed may also intersect with cybersecurity in interesting ways; feel free to ask in the comments how your degree might be related. 
##### Software Engineering (ECS)
**Relevant Domains:** Secure Software Development, Application Security
**Key Skills:** Linux/bash, C++, C, Assembly, Databases, Operating Systems, Software Testing, Technical Project Management, Statistics, Discrete Math & Linear Algebra
##### Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering (ECS)
Note EE has a Concentration in Computing Systems.
**Relevant Domains:** Hardware Security, Embedded Systems Security, IoT Security
**Key Skills:** C++, C, Assembly, Networks, Operating Systems, Embedded Systems Statistics, Discrete Math & Linear Algebra
##### Data Science (ECS & NSM)
**Relevant Domains:** AI for Cybersecurity, Cybersecurity for AI, Security Analytics, Anomaly Detection, Risk Modeling, Threat Intelligence
**Key Skills:** Python, C++, Databases, Statistics, Discrete Math & Linear Algebra
##### Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (JSOM)
This assumes the IT Concentration to specialize more in cybersecurity.
**Relevant Domains:** Security Analytics, Anomaly Detection, Risk Modeling, Threat Intelligence
**Key Skills:** Python, Statistics, Databases, Network Security, IT Architecture, Cloud, GRC
##### Mathematics (NSM)
**Relevant Domains:** Cryptography, Formal Verification
**Key Skills:** Python, Statistics, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra
##### Systems Engineering (ECS)
Note the secondary field requirement for the degree can be used to focus on computer science/cybersecurity.
**Relevant Domains:** Risk Management, Secure System Architecture, Cyber-Physical Security
**Key Skills:** Networks, Technical Project Management, Statistics, Discrete Math & Linear Algebra
##### Cognitive Science (BBS)
**Relevant Domains:** Social Engineering 
**Key Skills:** C++, Statistics, Psychology, Discrete Math

### Cybersecurity Minors and Certificates
Its very important to note that upper division (3000/4000) courses that you use to satisfy degree requirements for your major cannot count towards your minor. So if both your major and a minor require CS 4347, for example, you’ll only be able to count that towards your major and its unlikely you’ll be able to earn that minor.

This rule, doesn’t apply to certificates. So if you can’t earn the minor that you want, see if there is an equivalent certificate. 

Also note you must satisfy the prerequisites for any course you take. It will say it will take “X semester credit hours”, but this doesn’t take into account the prerequisites you might need so be sure to look at those when planning your degree.
##### ECS [Minors](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2025/undergraduate/programs/ecs/minors) and [Certificates](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2025/undergraduate/programs/ecs/certificates)
Cyber Security, Computer Science, and even Software Engineering minors may help less technical cybersecurity students take more technical coursework. 

The Certificate in Cyber Defense is a great alternative for ECS students to demonstrate their focus on cybersecurity by taking a few security-oriented electives (which may count as major technical electives on their degree plans).

##### JSOM [Minors](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2025/undergraduate/programs/jsom/minors) and [Certificates](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2025/undergraduate/programs/jsom/certificates)
Business Intelligence & Analytics or Information Technology and Systems can help both non-technical cybersecurity students get exposed to more technical course and technical students exposed to business and operations. Other JSOM minors or certificates may help in a similar way. 

I am getting a Business Intelligence & Analytics minor with my CS degree because it pairs especially well together. I am also getting the Certificate in Cyber Defense, largely because I wanted to take those electives anyways.

##### EPPS [Minors](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2025/undergraduate/programs/epps/minors) and [Certificates](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2025/undergraduate/programs/epps/certificates)
Criminology, Political Science, Public Affairs, Public Policy or Science, Technology, & Policy minors all would help a cybersecurity student understand privacy laws, GRC, cybercrime and other legal policies around cybersecurity. Some cybersecurity professionals go as far as to getting law degrees and many cybersecurity professionals end up getting security clearance in order to support the government’s cybersecurity initiatives through agencies or contractors.

# Cybersecurity Faculty?

# Cybersecurity Extracurriculars

Computer Security Group ([CSG](https://csg.utdallas.edu/aboutcsg/)). The oldest and largest cybersecurity club on campus. They do presentations (from students, industry professionals, or other speakers) every Wednesday at 7. Free pizza. They also hold capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions and organize cybersecurity conferences and other events.

Competitive CTF Team. CSG hosts UTD’s official competitive CTF team, currently ranked 17th in the US. A CTF competition involves using hacking techniques to break into systems setup as targets and score points by retrieving a flag (a secret piece of text). These are great for getting hands-on practice, and joining the competitive team represents join an incredibly elite group of hackers.

Cyber Defense and Response Unit (CDRU). We (I’m an officer) do hands-on workshops every Thursday at 7 PM on Digital Forensics, Incident Response, Threat Hunting and similar. We focus on defending systems, rather than attacking, and the club was founded by a CrowdStrike employee/UTD masters student to bridge the gap between classroom learning and careers. I became an officer because this is one of the most welcoming and interactive clubs I’ve encountered. Hands-on learning, but beginner friendly. 

National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition Team ([CCDC](https://www.nationalccdc.org/)). CDRU host’s UTD’s competitive cyber defense team, which made it to the Southwest Regional Competition last year. A cyber defense competition involves the team being handed IT infrastructure that they have to get up and running to score points, while a team of professional penetration testers (hackers) have been hired to break in and take them down.
