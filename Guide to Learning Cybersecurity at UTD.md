Hey everyone, here’s a quick (hopefully) helpful guide to Cybersecurity at UTD

# Why Cybersecurity
First off, what’s so great about going into cybersecurity? 

### Pros:
- **Money.** Any salary site will tell you cybersecurity is great financially.
- **Jobs.** Relative to software development or AI or a lot of other tech roles, cybersecurity is way less saturated (and there’s a reason for that)
- **AI-resistant Career.** So far, AI has had a pretty limited effect on cybersecurity careers. Certainly AI tools are being used and developed, but they aren’t really much different than what non-AI tools do. And bad guys are using AI to ramp up the volume of attacks, but that actually helps our careers. More people will be needed as AI allows unskilled hackers/”script kiddies” to perform more attacks that are better customized to their targets. Also there’s work securing AIs and their infrastructure from hacks. Most importantly, in the event of AI taking over the world, its well [documented](https://www.google.com/search?num=10&sca_esv=2b991d5e6e40b86a&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS1089US1089&q=the+matrix&si=AMgyJEsoqqCSw2F100vuSHAv-MXEENcEAzHJng0a_IrXNE6tf66bbzAE6s74rkx5Id-3ezM7pnoEhUAWbglOXir0ZSIxrQK-g94NRrFeMjmn0XSi99wed5E%3D&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwiSvsP8w5KOAxWDkmoFHUJhB7oQyNoBKAB6BAgfEAA&ictx=1) that hackers have the best chance of surviving.
- **Community.** The community is amazing too and there are a lot of open-source projects you can dive into. Also, you don't have to know coding to start! It's a great field to transition into no matter your background as there is something for everyone because the field is so diverse.
- **Cool factor.** Hacking and defending systems is a lot of fun for someone who likes tinkering with technology.

### Neutrals:
- **Continuous Learning.** There’s an expectation that you keep up with cybersecurity trends and new technologies and there’s a whole market for cybersecurity credentials/certificates, conferences, professional development, etc. If you expect your studies to end after graduating, cybersecurity might not be for you.
- **Depth and Breadth.** Cybersecurity is a lot to learn. Its exciting, but also intimidating. Be prepared for a challenge and feeling like you don’t know that much for a long time. This also means there’s a little bit for everyone. No matter your background, there’s probably a way your experience helps you know something about cybersecurity. 
- **Maintenance.** Cybersecurity is a continuous process. Its not something you do and then you’re done. If you do it right the first time and you setup systems to help you handle problems, your job is relatively easy, but often this is not the case. Typically you’re having to deal with problems left by your predecessors. 

### Cons:
- **Barriers to Entry.** Cybersecurity, with its breadth and depth, is an advanced domain. Its fundamentals (networking, operating systems, databases) are topics that typically don’t get covered until pretty late in your degree. Most people work in IT or engineering for a year or two before going into Cybersecurity. This is why the market is less saturated, its harder to get into.
- **Certification Costs.** Well-respected certs are typically expensive which is a problem for us broke college kids. Ideally, whoever you work for will support getting you certified and help cover some or all of the costs, but it can be hard to get these as an individual. I’ll be sure to point you towards any resources UTD has for this.
- **Demographics.** Although the backgrounds of cybersecurity professionals are diverse (I’ve met lawyers, rock stars, people with PhDs and people with no degrees, and more who are all working in cybersecurity) it is male-dominated like many other STEM-fields.

# Cybersecurity Extracurriculars

Computer Security Group ([CSG](https://csg.utdallas.edu/aboutcsg/)). The oldest and largest cybersecurity club on campus. They do presentations (from students, industry professionals, or other speakers) every Wednesday at 7. Free pizza. They also hold capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions and organize cybersecurity conferences and other events.

Competitive CTF Team. CSG hosts UTD’s official competitive CTF team, currently ranked 17th in the US. A CTF competition involves using hacking techniques to break into systems setup as targets and score points by retrieving a flag (a secret piece of text). These are great for getting hands-on practice, and joining the competitive team represents join an incredibly elite group of hackers.

Cyber Defense and Response Unit (CDRU). We (I’m an officer) do hands-on workshops every Thursday at 7 PM on Digital Forensics, Incident Response, Threat Hunting and similar. We focus on defending systems, rather than attacking, and the club was founded by a CrowdStrike employee/UTD masters student to bridge the gap between classroom learning and careers. I became an officer because this is one of the most welcoming and interactive clubs I’ve encountered. Hands-on learning, but beginner friendly. 

National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition Team ([CCDC](https://www.nationalccdc.org/)). CDRU host’s UTD’s competitive cyber defense team, which made it to the Southwest Regional Competition last year. A cyber defense competition involves the team being handed IT infrastructure that they have to get up and running to score points, while a team of professional penetration testers (hackers) have been hired to break in and take them down.
